Release of BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics Managed Solution Widens Badger Meter
Leadership Position


We are proud to introduce our new end-to-end managed solution for water utility management, BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA). BEACON AMA combines the intuitive BEACON AMA software suite with proven ORIONÂ® Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) technology, using fixed and cellular networks to give utilities greater control, more information and enhanced customer service. Built-in infrastructure management services and supplied endpoint upgrades eliminate maintenance and technology concerns. Consumer engagement tools help enhance customer service, increase customer satisfaction and reduce costs.


With the release of BEACON AMA, Badger Meter also

becomes the first major water meter company to

release a cost-effective cellular based solution for

system-wide deployment.


BEACON AMA gives you a powerful solution for any water

utility customer looking for the benefits of fixed network

and analytics, but also wanting the convenience of a

managed solution.


To support sales efforts, starting in February, BEACON AMA will be promoted with a fully integrated campaign, including print and online advertising, public relations, and trade show and conference promotion.
