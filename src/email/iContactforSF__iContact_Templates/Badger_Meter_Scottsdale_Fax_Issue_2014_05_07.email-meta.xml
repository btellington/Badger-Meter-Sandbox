Special Announcement - Scottsdale Fax Issue | May 7, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Dear Badger Meter Cox Sales Representatives,

Due to technical issues with fax numbers at our Badger Meter office in Scottsdale, AZ, we were not receiving faxed communication between the dates of March 14, 2014 and May 2, 2014. This affects products manufactured in Scottsdale, including Cox and Flow Dynamics.
As of Friday afternoon, May 2, all fax numbers were restored to proper working order. Unfortunately, we are unable to recover any faxes that may have been missed.
If you or your customer sent an order, request for quote, or any other message via fax to Badger Meter Scottsdale within this time frame, please contact Customer Service at
480-922-7446 ext. 14 or jbaxter@badgermeter.com to check on the status of your order.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or delays this has caused.
Sincerely,
Tracy Lagona
Director - Industrial Sales
