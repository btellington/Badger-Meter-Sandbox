Next Generation ORION SE2 and ME2 Endpoints

Badger Meter is in the process of transitioning to the next generation of ORION SE and ME endpoint hardware. You may have already received shipments which included a “2” after ORION SE or ME on the box and endpoint labels. Since there are no functional changes to the endpoint, only hardware component changes, this transition is being implemented as a running change, and the “2” is used for internal identification purposes only. ORION SE2 and ME2 endpoints are fully compatible with existing ORION SE and ME endpoint installations, as well as ORION fixed network and mobile and handheld reading systems. No system changes are required to support these new versions. The transition to SE2 and ME2 endpoints will occur as inventory of the first generation product has been consumed.


An updated version of the ORION SE/ME Endpoint Firmware Updater software, which supports first and second generation endpoint firmware updates, is in process and will be available early January.


Please contact Sheila Nally if you have any questions.
