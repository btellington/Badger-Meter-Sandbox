on Back Order
The Data Industrial 4000 Series Impeller Meters are currently on back order. We anticipate resuming shipment of 4000 Series meters on January 20, 2014. We apologize for the inconvenience. This situation was caused by a supplier issue and corrective action has been taken.
To mitigate this situation from occurring on future orders, we have established an alternate supplier for the affected subcomponent.
