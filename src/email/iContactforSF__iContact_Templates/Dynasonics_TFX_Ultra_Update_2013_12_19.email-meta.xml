Update on Dynasonics TFX Ultra Platform | December 19, 2013

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Dear Dynasonics Representative:
We are pleased to announce the new general safety AC line power and DC power Dynasonics TFX Ultra transmitters are released for shipment. When ordering the new transmitters, the certification approval option “N” is now available for all power source selections.
In the meantime, the hazardous area transmitters with Ethernet communications or AC line power remain on hold. If you have any open orders that need to be converted from hazardous area approval to general safety or another alternative, please contact your Badger Meter representative to revise your orders.
