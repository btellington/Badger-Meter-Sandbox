Update on Dynasonics TFX Ultra Platform | January 22, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Dear Dynasonics Representative:
For installations requiring hazardous area certification, the hazardous area TFX Ultra transmitters with AC line power or Ethernet communications remain on hold. These transmitters are expected to be released in late February, pending certification approval.
As previously communicated, transmitters with general safety certification are available including the new AC line powered and DC powered options. If you have any open orders that need to be converted from hazardous area approval to general safety or another alternative, please contact your Badger Meter representative to revise your orders.

Sincerely,
