Update on Dynasonics TFX Ultra Platform | March 13, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Dear Dynasonics Representative:

For installations requiring hazardous area certification, the hazardous area TFX Ultra transmitters with AC line power or Ethernet communications remain on hold. As previously communicated, we expected to release these transmitters in late February, pending certification approval. We sincerely regret to inform you that due to circumstances beyond our control, the MET approval agency is severely behind schedule and has postponed completion of the review. Based on our latest discussions with the approval agency, we anticipate MET will complete certification approval by June 27, 2014.

Transmitters with general safety certification remain available, including the new AC line powered and DC powered options. If you have any open orders that can be converted from hazardous area approval to general safety or another alternative, please contact your Badger Meter representative to revise your orders.

We remain in close contact with MET to drive to a resolution for this issue and will continue to provide updates. We genuinely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.

Sincerely,
Cheryl Ades Anspach
Marketing Manager
