Update on Dynasonics TFX Ultra Platform | March 21, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Dear Dynasonics Representative:

In an effort to expedite the release schedule for the TFX Ultra hazardous area transmitters, we have requested that the approval agency allow a phased approach to the approval process.  For U.S. and Canada, we received approval for use in hazardous areas of the remaining TFX Ultra transmitters, while the ATEX certification for Europe remains under review.

In order to meet the demand for installations in the U.S. and Canada, we are releasing the remaining TFX Ultra hazardous area transmitters for sale in the U.S. and Canada with the following changes:

Transmitters will be marked for Class I, Division 2 Groups C and D area in U.S. and Canada
Transmitters will not be marked  with Ex and CE
An insert will be included with the transmitter advising of the certification changes for applicable transmitters

For any orders of transmitters that will ultimately be used in Europe or require the CE and ATEX approval, please contact your Badger Meter representative by the end of the business day on March 25th.  Otherwise, we will assume that these changes are satisfactory.

No action is necessary if the modifications noted above are acceptable on existing orders.

We remain in close contact with the approval agency to finalize the ATEX certification.  We appreciate your business and regret the interruptions that this product hold has caused.

Sincerely,
