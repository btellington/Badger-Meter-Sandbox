Introducing Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation


Today we publicly announced the re-branding of the Badger Meter flow measurement and control product line, which has expanded and evolved through product development and acquisitions.


The new Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation name reflects broad solutions for the global industrial and commercial markets, which help keep plant processes and precision-based operations efficient, profitable and safe.


“Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation understands that companies cannot manage what they cannot measure,” said Beth Thomas, director of marketing. “We leverage more than a century of flow measurement expertise and advanced, yet proven technology to optimize the most demanding applications. Badger Meter offers an extensive portfolio of products, services and solutions to measure and control whatever moves through pipelines, including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.”

New Look, New Market Position


The most visible aspect of our Flow Instrumentation re-branding is the new red product logos and red &quot;flowing B&quot; Badger Meter logo. The new product logos listed below are designed to be cohesive and complementary to each other. The common look and feel reinforces that these products are all part of the Badger Meter family of products, builds on our strong brand names and helps show the market that Badger Meter has a technological solution for virtually any flow application. This new look will also help differentiate Badger Meter from major competitors in the marketplace.


You will start seeing these logos immediately on our updated
Flow Instrumentation web pages, at trade shows, in advertisments, and in marketing literature. Over the next few years, as new products are developed and current products evolve, the new logos and red branding will be applied at the product interface level.


The new logos are now available for download on the extranet. Here&apos;s a sneak peek.
