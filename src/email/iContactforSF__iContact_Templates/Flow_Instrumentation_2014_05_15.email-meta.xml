Prevent Process System Defects Before They Become Costly Breakdowns




For processing plant managers in virtually all industries, ranging from pet food to petrochemicals, it&apos;s important to identify problematic equipment or system issues before they evolve into larger, more costly failures. System defects need to be identified quickly and on the fly, without interrupting the process or causing production downtime.


When it comes to process flow, irregular flow rates are a common indication of a leak, blockage, or other defect in a process pipeline. In many cases, meters are installed permanently into pipelines to achieve on-going flow metering. In other cases, where permanent meters are not installed or when systems are frequently altered to accommodate ever-changing processes, it&apos;s important for plant maintenance personnel to have the flexibility to quickly monitor flow without breaking into the pipeline and holding up production.



An ideal solution is to use
non-invasive ultrasonic flow meters, which are easily clamped onto the outside of pipes without interfering with process flow. The Dynasonics DXN portable flow meter is capable of measuring a wide range of fluid types, from water to slurries using ultrasonic sensors set to Doppler or Transit Time Flight modes.


Using an intuitive Windows-based touchscreen interface on the meter, technicians can store multiple custom site parameters on the meter to allow for quick set-up at different monitoring locations throughout the process for easy system spot checks. Measurement data can also be logged and saved offline for comparison of equipment operation over time, which allows operation personnel to recognize long-term performance trends.


Using a Dynasonics DXN portable flow meter can help companies control maintenance and lost production costs by quickly and easily identifying irregularities in process flow.

New Hedland Test Kits Available



Hedland in-line test kits offer customers a cost efficient way to maintain and improve the performance of fluid-based or compressed gas systems. Like Hedland flow meters, test kits provide users with a quick, easy flow rate reading. However, test kits take it a step further and allow users to view both flow pressure and flow rate, simultaneously.


The newest offering in our line of Hedland test kits have been designed with improved valve technology, which allows for more accurate response to sensitive flow rate fluctuations. Plus, the test kits now feature an internal burst disc to prevent damage to hydraulic systems in case of excessive pressure due to accidental valve closure.


In addition to improved functionality, the new test kits have been designed to be more streamlined with the rest of the Hedland meter offering. Using a variety of line connection adapters, the new tests kits can be easily connected to different line sizes and connection types.


Available in 1-1/4 and 1-1/2 inch sizes with aluminum and stainless steel construction options, the new test kits are compatible with water-based, petroleum-based, and phosphate ester-based fluids.


Hedland is an open channel product line, which means you don&apos;t need to be specifically contracted to sell Hedland meters.
