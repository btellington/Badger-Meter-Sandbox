Dynasonics Product Updates




Dynasonics TFX Ultra Enhancements
New TFX Ultra firmware revision R, supporting baud rate selection for BACnet MSTP and German language support became available on May 28. As a result of the MSTP baud rate update, it is no longer necessary to specify the baud rate as an order option. Please continue to use Advanced Communication option “B” for BACnet MSTP since option “H” will be discontinued in the future. The new firmware is available online at the TFX Ultra web page in English, French, Spanish, and German languages.
Fusion Hybrid Meters to be Discontinued
The discontinuation of Fusion Hybrid Meters is a strategic decision to more closely align with market demand. Fusion meters employ both Doppler and transit time ultrasonic technology. Orders for any last-time purchases need to be received by August 15, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Badger Meter will continue to offer repair services to support this product line, as well as several alternative products to meet our customers&apos; needs.

TFX Transit Time
DXN Portable Hybrid

Flow Instrumentation Website Consolidation


As previously communicated, we have been working on moving all external websites to www.badgermeter.com. We recently finished migrating the last three remaining external product websites for Blancett, Dynasonics and Preso, making the Badger Meter website the single source for customers to find information on all of our products and services.


The website migration is part of a larger effort to strengthen the cohesiveness among all Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation products. Having all of our product information on one website will allow for a more unified display of Badger Meter products, enable more opportunities for cross-selling and create synergy between product lines.

NEW RCV Patented Accurate
Linkage System Brochure



We have designed a cutting-edge linkage system for Research Control® Valves that provides a high level of accuracy while managing the expectations of demanding applications. The patented linkage system ensures accuracy and longevity by preventing position erosion by use of a
spring-loaded dual contact guide, which eliminates the slop associated with standard brackets.
