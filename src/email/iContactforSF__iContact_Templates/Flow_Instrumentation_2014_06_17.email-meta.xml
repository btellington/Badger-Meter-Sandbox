Massive Mag Meters Pass the Test


Recently, two large mag meters, 54 and 60 inches in diameter, underwent successful performance testing at the Utah Water Resource Lab at Utah State University. The tests included water flow ranges of 4500 to 80,000 gallons per minute. Overall, the meters measured one million gallons of water during the one-day test.


The meters satisfied the accuracy requirements set by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and are currently en route to their final destination in Mentone, CA. The DWR is planning to install the meters this summer as part of a large municipal project, which will increase their water distribution capacity and reliability, allowing them to meet expanding fresh water demands in several southern California counties.


Badger Meter has a unique capability to design and manufacture mag meters of exceptional size and durability. When the California DWR began requesting proposals for this project, Badger Meter was the sole company to step up to the challenge. Not only are the meters impressive in size and accuracy, but the flange connections meet the California DWR&apos;s seismic force specifications to help the meters withstand the potential effects of area earthquakes.


Stay tuned for more details on this application.

Flow Instrumentation Value -
More Than Measurement and Control
Today’s industries face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety and regulatory requirements. To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems. This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation, and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
Customers can rely on Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, and regulatory compliance.
Here are a few brief examples of benefits provided by our flow instrumentation products, beyond simply accurate measurement and control:


Product Quality
Achieve high quality in their products by: ensuring correct and accurate ingredient mixes, reducing variability in process flow due to temperature and pressure changes, and obtaining precise performance data in research and development.


Cost Control
Control operating costs and revenue by: accurately measuring products in custody transfer, optimizing process energy and commodity usage, monitor resource consumption, and preventing theft of valuable fluids.


Operational Safety
Keep their plant, their customers and their employees safe by: monitoring for abnormal process conditions, controlling flow pressure and temperature, and detecting potentially harmful fugitive emissions.


Regulatory Compliance
Keep up with stringent regulations related to their operations, such as EPA, DHS, DEA, OSHA, and NVLAP by: detecting leaks or overfill, maintaining precise flow data for accurate accounting reporting, and keeping track of process flow waste.
