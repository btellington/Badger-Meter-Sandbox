Flow Instrumentation Edition | July 1, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Congratulations, Morrie Clayton!
On June 30, 2014, Morrie Clayton retired from Badger Meter after 20 years of service. During his long tenure at Badger Meter, Morrie has been instrumental in developing municipal and industrial flow instrumentation markets, contributing his flow meter expertise in several different sales roles.


Kim Stoll, VP of Sales &amp; Marketing, congratulates Morrie Clayton on his retirement and 20 outstanding years of employment at Badger Meter.

Morrie started with Badger Meter in May of 1994 as technical sales manager. Coming to Badger Meter with a background in Electrical Engineering, Morrie made an immediate impact supporting the ultrasonic meter division in Tulsa. At that time, ultrasonic meters were an open channel product, often used in sewage measurement applications. “I spent a lot of time calling on design engineers, climbing down manholes to install meters surrounded by sewage,” said Morrie. Now that’s dedication!
As Morrie’s knowledge of Badger Meter products grew, so did the Flow Instrumentation portfolio. Morrie was a key subject matter expert through the acquisitions of ReMag, Data Industrial and Racine Federated, where he was responsible for integrating entire sales representative networks for impeller and municipal meter markets. Upon the acquisition of Racine Federated, Morrie transitioned toward a sales support manager role, fully responsible for the U.S. water/wastewater sales representative network. Morrie’s experience in this market was invaluable in supporting and training new and existing sales representatives.
Recently, Morrie moved to his new home on the shores of New Jersey, where he enjoys kayaking on the beautiful open water. During his retirement, Morrie plans to spend time volunteering, golfing and traveling. In between his international trips, Morrie also plans to visit his two sons, who live in San Francisco, CA, and Bellingham, WA.
On behalf of everyone at Badger Meter, we wish Morrie a very happy and well-deserved retirement. Thank you, Morrie, for your outstanding 20 years of hard work and dedication!
