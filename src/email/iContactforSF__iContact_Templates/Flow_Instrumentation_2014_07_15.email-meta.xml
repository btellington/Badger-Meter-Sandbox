Dynasonics® Updates
Industrial RTD Clamp On Kit Price Reduction
The industrial RTD kits are ideal for high temperatures, frequent reuse and environments that may have excessive condensation or contaminants. In many applications, the industrial RTD kits may be a better choice than the commercial RTD kits. To encourage customers to consider the industrial RTD kits, prices have been reduced for Dynasonics TFX Ultra and DXN meter industrial RTD kits. Additionally, the energy version of Dynasonics DXN portable is now shipping with the industrial RTD clamp on kits.
Coming Soon! Dynasonics DTTR Transducers
and Rail System


In August, the new easier-to-install transducers and rail system will be available for pipes two inches and larger. The DTTR transducers route cables parallel to the pipe and incorporate a holding mechanism for the new rail system.
The DTTR transducer replaces the DTTN general purpose transducer with either the cord grip or flexible armor: conduit options N or A. Additionally, the rail system holds the transducers in place and includes a sight window for easier measurement of the spacing distance between two transducers and is available as an accessory.
Further information will be forthcoming in updated TFX Ultra and TFXL Product Data Sheets.
New Dynasonics Price List Effective August 15

Fusion Hybrid Meters to be Discontinued
The discontinuation of Fusion Hybrid Meters is a strategic decision to more closely align with market demand. Fusion meters employ both Doppler and transit time ultrasonic technology. Orders for any last-time purchases need to be received by August 15, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Badger Meter will continue to offer repair services to support this product line, as well as several alternative products to meet our customers&apos; needs:

DFX Doppler
TFX Transit Time
DXN Portable Hybrid

Hedland® Updates




New Price List


The Hedland price list has two small updates on page 206. NPTF was replaced with NPT and SAE was removed from the Nominal Port Size. The new price list is available for download on the extranet.




Vista Gauges Discontinued


Effective immediately, the Hedland Vista gauge product line is no longer available for purchase. The strategic discontinuation of the Vista gauge product line more closely aligns our Hedland product offering with customer needs.

Research Control® Updates




Valves and Positioners Now Powder Coat Painted


We are excited to communicate another step forward in our effort for continuous improvement. Badger Meter has upgraded their painting methods to reflect a thicker, more durable paint that remains environmentally friendly. We have made a wide variety of improvements over the last several years. Going forward, we will make an effort to communicate those features and advantages. View the PDF announcement.


Powder Coat Paint Advantages:

Thicker coat - The main difference between powder and conventional liquid coatings is that powder coatings are applied in the form of free flowing powders, whereas liquid coatings require water or an organic solvent to keep the resin in the form of a suspension. Our thermosetting powder allows for an evenly applied coat which produces a longer product life.
Improved environmental safety - Badger Meter is aware of its responsibility to be a good environmental partner while maintaining the highest quality standards in our products. Powder coating enables the elimination of solvents and hazardous wastes, as well as zero or near-zero VOC emissions during the coating process.
Increased durability - Powder coatings provide the same level of corrosion and wear protection as their liquid paint counterparts. However, in comparison to liquid coatings, powders make thicker films possible because they tend not to run, drip, or sag during the application process. Powder coated parts are more resistant to cracking, peeling, and marring during handling and normal use. Powder coatings are particularly suitable for corrosion-prone applications where thicker coatings provide added protection and durability.
