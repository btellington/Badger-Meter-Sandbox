NEW Guide to Common Valve
Terminology


It can sometimes be challenging to remember the many technical terms used in different industries and technologies, such as the terminology used to describe process control valves. Terms like &quot;bonnet&quot; may be unfamiliar to those new to an industry or technology.


To assist you in the field, we&apos;ve create a new document, which provides definitions and explanations of common terminology related to control valves and liquid process systems. The new glossary is available for download on the Research ControlÂ® Valves page on the Badger Meter website.
