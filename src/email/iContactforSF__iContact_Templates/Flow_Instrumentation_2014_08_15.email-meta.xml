Special Capabilities Extend Beyond Stocked
Meter Offering
Our new stocked meter plan offers shorter lead times for a wide breadth of ModMAG M-Series® meters, which meet the requirements of many common applications. However, in some unique or especially challenging applications, there may be a need for a meter to be engineered outside the realm of our stocked meter offering.
Our team of highly experienced and knowledgeable application engineers has what it takes to recommend and design custom solutions for complex metering applications. Customers can rely on our manufacturing flexibility to produce a tailor-made meter to meet custom needs, such as special lay lengths or meter sizes.
This picture shows an example of a ModMAG M-Series meter with an exceptionally long lay length. There were two meters installed at this site with lay lengths of 55 inches and 61 inches. The meters were measuring potable water at the Ries Water Supply Company in Wört, Southern Germany. The extended lay lengths required for this installation provided Badger Meter an opportunity to offer this customer a solution where other meter suppliers could not.
In another application, two large mag meters, 54 and 60 inches in diameter, were designed for a project in which the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) would increase their water distribution capacity and reliability, allowing them to meet expanding fresh water demands in several southern California counties. This picture was taken at a test facility where the meters met accuracy standards set by the California DWR at flow ranges ranging from 4500 to 80,000 gallons per minute.
Badger Meter has a unique capability to design and manufacture mag meters of exceptional size and durability. When the California DWR began requesting proposals for this project, Badger Meter was the sole company to step up to the challenge. Not only are the meters impressive in size and accuracy, but the flange connections meet the California DWR&apos;s seismic force specifications to help the meters withstand the potential effects of area earthquakes.

RCV SRI990 Valve Positioner Electrical

Certification Change


Effective immediately, we are no longer offering the Research Control® SRI990 valve positioner with either the CSA or FM Intrinsically Safe electrical certification.


The digital SRD991 valve positioner is a direct replacement which offers substantial advantages over the SRI990. The SRD991 will continue to be offered in CSA and FM Intrinsically Safe models, as well as a variety of other electrical certifications. The SRD991 has several advantages including:

Cost effective
Simple three button setup for onsite valve adjustment
Improved flexibility and accuracy through visual representation of positioner orientation and setup
Advanced diagnostics is a standard feature
LCD interface displays intuitive, simple language for ease of use
