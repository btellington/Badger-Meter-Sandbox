Organizational Changes Put Added Focus on Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation


As of September 1, 2014, Greg Gomez moved from his role as VP of Business Development to his new role as VP of Flow Instrumentation. Greg has responsibility for Flow Instrumentation product development, manufacturing, customer service, sales and marketing. Kim Stoll remains VP of Sales &amp; Marketing for Utility products and will be responsible for the integration and management of the recently announced intention to acquire National Meter &amp; Automation, Inc.


Greg’s appointment to be a dedicated VP of Flow Instrumentation stems from the commitment of Badger Meter CEO, Rich Meeusen, and our investors to the Flow Instrumentation business. With a VP devoted solely to the Flow Instrumentation business, Badger Meter is poised to make improvements in many aspects of the business by increasing coordination between various internal departments involved in the design, manufacture and sale of flow instrumentation products. Many of the flow instrumentation products came to Badger Meter through acquisitions and while the majority effort was spent on integrating sales and marketing functions, the recent organizational shift allows for improved utilization and alignment of resources in all areas of the business.


With a sharpened focus on business and operational processes, Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation is positioned for long-term growth in sales and product development, as well as continuing to heighten the quality of service to customers around the world.

High Temperature Gas Control for Automotive
Test Cell - Research Control® Valves


Our latest case study describes how an automotive test system manufacturer used advanced gas control technology, provided by Badger Meter. The application required a robust device for modulating high-temperature exhaust gas as part of a backpressure measurement solution in an engine test cell. Read the entire story online or download the PDF.
Here are the highlights from the application:
Challenge:

Fluid temperature of 850° F is higher than the capabilities of a normal control valve and packing pairing
High shut-off pressure of 300 psig
Accurate and reliable pressure control was necessary for a successful application

Solution

Research Control® Valve Model 9000
ANSI Class 300
316 Stainless steel body with 10 in. extended bonnet and graphite packing
6…30 psig bench range with 12 psig reload
High-accuracy pneumatic positioner overcomes high temperature to allow for 50:1 valve rangeability
