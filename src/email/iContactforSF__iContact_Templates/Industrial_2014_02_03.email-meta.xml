PC200 Replacing PC100 Process Controller
​There are currently limited quantities of PC100 process controllers left in stock. Once the PC100 stock is depleted, the PC200 will be substituted for all orders going forward. To assist users in this transition, we have created a wiring cross reference guide showing connection equivalents between PC100 and PC200 controllers. You can download the reference guide online.


Based on the core functionality of PC100 controllers, the PC200 has evolved to offer additional capability through an easy-to-use interface. The PC200 is a microprocessor-driven instrument designed for batching and filling both small and large quantities, as well as displaying total, accumulated total and flow rate.
