The meters are designed for flow measurement of low-viscosity and non-aggressive liquids, including demineralized water, alkaline solutions, fuel consumption, oils, salad oil, beverages, water solutions, and coolants.

The meter is especially suitable for washing machines, dishwashers, coffee machines, laser cooling plants, solar solutions, bakery machines, steam cooking machines in large kitchen plants, and CD or DVD cleaning.

Recordall® Turbo Series Meters Offering Update


Badger Meter 16 and 20 inch Recordall Turbo Series meters and head assemblies are being discontinued by our supplier. We have a limited number of complete meters available for new orders and a small inventory of head assemblies available to support existing meters in the field. Please check availability with Customer Service prior to accepting orders for this product.


As an alternative to these turbo meters, customers should be transitioned to our
M-Series® electromagnetic flow meter offering. When compared to a Turbo meter, the
M-Series mag meter provides a more accurate and cost effective solution for applications with large flow requirements.

Research Control® Valve Document Updates
Several technical reference documents have been updated for the Research Control Valve product line. The new documents include up-to-date specifications and photos and have been reformatted for improved usability.
