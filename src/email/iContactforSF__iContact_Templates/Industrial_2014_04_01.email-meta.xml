Blancett Meters Help Hydraulic Fracturing Companies Keep the Environment Safe and Meet Government Regulations




Hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, is a process used to extract underground natural resources from below the Earth’s surface. These resources include oil, natural gas, geothermal energy, and even water. The process includes pumping fracturing fluid at high pressures into a well, sometimes drilled thousands of feet deep. The pressure of the fluid creates cracks in the underground rock, allowing trapped resources to flow up the well.


Since the fracturing fluid contains chemicals and consumes water, companies are required by state and federal law to maintain accurate records of process fluid injected into and recovered from wells. The laws help ensure environmental and public safety.


With high accuracy and a rugged design, Blancett 1100 Series meters in six, eight and 10 inch line sizes are an ideal solution for measuring process liquid in hydraulic fracturing operations in the U.S. and Canada; often mounted on the pump trucks that deliver and recover the process water. Blancett meters maintain high accuracy while withstanding on-truck vibration and harsh conditions.


Additionally, the Blancett B3000 monitor can be used with the 1100 Series meters to provide customers with a durable, easy-to-use meter interface, which simultaneously displays flow rate and flow total. The B3000 allows for greater control and visibility of flow with features such as alarm parameters, advanced connectivity options and a variety of mounting options.


Blancett repair kits also present additional opportunities in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The repair kits are designed for use with Blancett meters as well as many competitive turbine meter designs found in hydraulic fracturing operations. Even if a customer doesn’t have an immediate need for new meters, offering repair kits can help get your foot in the door, with potential for earning new meter orders in the future.


Blancett turbine meters are offered by Badger Meter as an open distribution product line. This means that all of our representatives are authorized to sell Blancett meters.
