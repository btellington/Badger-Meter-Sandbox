Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation


When: Friday, April 25 at
10:30 a.m. CST
(You will receive a separate email invitation to register for the webinar.)
What: We have some exciting news to share with you regarding a re-branding effort for the Badger Meter flow instrumentation (formerly &quot;Industrial&quot;) products.
Highlights:

Differentiates our brand from competition
Enables new cross-selling opportunities
Unifies our global product offering
Refined global message

The new Flow Instrumentation name reflects broad solutions for the global industrial and commercial markets, which help keep plant processes and precision-based operations efficient, profitable and safe. In recent years, our solution offering has expanded through product development and acquisitions. The re-branding will help differentiate Badger Meter products from competitive offerings. It also strengthens the cohesiveness among all Badger Meter flow instrumentation products, enabling more opportunities for cross-selling into new applications.
Who: Judson Luke, Integrated Marketing Services Manager, will be presenting a 20 minute, quick-hitting webinar presentation to explain the logic behind the launch of Badger Meter Flow Instrumentation.


Introducing the NEW ModMAG® M1000 Mag Meter


The M1000 meter is the newest member of the M-Series® family, combining a general purpose detector with an amplifier representing the next generation of electromagnetic flow meter signal processing. The M1000 is available in an easy-to-use, &quot;no-frills&quot; package with a streamlined feature set for use in a wide range of global commercial markets.


Brooke Lange, product specialist, commented, “The M1000 electromagnetic flow meter was specifically developed for industrial water/wastewater, machinery plants, commercial vehicles and batching process applications. Its measuring pipes are lined with material approved for use with drinking water per the NSF-61 standards. Plus, rugged construction and resistance to vibration make the meter ideal for truck-mounted operation for process fluid in the hydraulic fracturing industry.”


Badger Meter has broadened the M1000 communication connection protocols to include Modbus® RTU, RS232, RS422 and RS485 options. In addition, the meter offers two new feature kits: Data Logging and Firmware Upgrade.
