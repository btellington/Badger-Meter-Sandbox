Temporary Lead Time Increase for RCV Valves | February 12, 2014

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Temporary Lead Time Increase for
Research Control® Valves
Standing by commitments to our customers is of the highest priority for Badger Meter. Due to an increase in valve orders, we are temporarily increasing lead times for standard and special orders for Research Control® Valves.
If there are critical time frames for specific orders, please contact our sales department. We will do our best to offer the Hot Shot delivery service according to our current stated policy found in the RCV Price List, but we ask for your cooperation in using this expediting process for the highest priority orders.
If you have any questions, please contact your sales representative or customer service.
Sincerely,
Brian Kettner
Marketing Manager
RCV-Research Control Valves and Preso
