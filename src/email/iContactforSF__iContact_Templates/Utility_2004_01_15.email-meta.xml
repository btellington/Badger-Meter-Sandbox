Itron 100W+ Transition Update

We are happy to announce the 100W+ is now shipping and order lead times should return to normal. Only a limited number of 100W ERTs remain and will be used to fulfill orders based on availability and configuration. Please make sure you have notified your 100W customers of the transition to 100W+ ERTs so they may prepare their utility systems accordingly. Please refer to the November 15, 2013 utility eNews for more information.
