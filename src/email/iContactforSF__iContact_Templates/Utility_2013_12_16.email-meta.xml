Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Next Generation ORION SE2 and ME2 Endpoints

Badger Meter ORION SE2 and ME2 are now shipping. This next generation of endpoint hardware includes changes only to hardware components. There are no functional changes. Thus, ORION SE2 and ME2 endpoints, as denoted in our system, are fully compatible with existing ORION SE and ME endpoint installations, as well as ORION fixed network, mobile and handheld reading systems. No system changes are required to support these new versions.


An updated version of the ORION SE/ME Endpoint Firmware Updater software, which supports first and second generation endpoint firmware updates, is in process and will be available early January.


Please contact Sheila Nally if you have any questions.

Utility Products Price Book is Now Available


The 2014 utility products price book is now available on the Badger Meter extranet. These new prices will go into effect on January 6, 2014. Please remember, volume discounts are applied per line, per configuration and to one shipping location.


Note: Any new orders created between today and

January 6, 2014 that are not tied to an existing, active quote or bid must stipulate that product needs to ship prior to or on February 28, 2014.


Planning for the Holidays? Give Badger Meter Gear


A great way to keep Badger Meter top of mind, now and throughout the year, is to wear branded apparel and to give items as gifts. Now you can conveniently shop for a wide range of Badger Meter merchandise – from shirts and hats to water bottles and pens – using the online store located on the

Badger Meter extranet.


New merchandise will be made available over time and suggestions are always welcome.


Special notes:

Distributors and Sales Reps: Purchases of Badger Meter promotional items by distributors and representatives are eligible for applicable co-op programs, according to the requirements of
the program.
Badger Meter Employees: All purchases made by Badger Meter employees should be placed online, using the employees’ credit card. Please do not call or email ABC Gifts/Branovan directly to place orders.
Badger Meter Trade Shows and Events: Trade Show mandated apparel for Badger Meter staff will be ordered through Amie Williams, Badger Meter Sr. Marketing Events Specialist. These special orders will be placed for Badger Meter employees at no charge.

If you have any questions please contact Judson Luke or Amie Williams.
