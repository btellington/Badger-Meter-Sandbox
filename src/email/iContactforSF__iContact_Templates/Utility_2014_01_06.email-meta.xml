Milwaukee Green Roof Update

In late 2012, Badger Meter faced the decision of how to best replace the 10,000 square foot roof on top of our corporate headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A green roof, which delivers numerous financial and environmental benefits, was determined to be the best option for this renovation.

At the time the green roof was added, Badger Meter also installed some of its very own 2” M-Series® Electromagnetic flow meters to track and monitor runoff from the green roof. The open flow tube design of the M-Series meter is perfect for this application, due to the the potential runoff of rocks, sticks and debris.


Data from 2013:

Rainfall: 42.45 inches (254,092 gallons)

M-Series runoff reading: 113,103 gallons

Green Roof retention: 140,989 gallons

Badger Meter has been able to keep a significant amount of runoff away from Milwaukee&apos;s sewers, which helps reduce the load on water treatment facilities.
