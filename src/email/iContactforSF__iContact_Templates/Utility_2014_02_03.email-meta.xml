The newest member of the E-Series electronic metering line was designed for utility potable water applications. The engineered polymer models provide your customers with a cost-effective option for electronic and, specifically, ultrasonic metering. The engineered polymer line includes the following sizes: 5/8 x 3/4”, 3/4”, 3/4” and 1”, the newest addition.


All of our E-Series Ultrasonic meters are regulation-compliant and are available in a wide range of sizing options in either engineered polymer or stainless steel. Your choice in a water metering solution counts – choose from the many Badger Meter offerings to find a solution that meets your specific needs.

Lay Length - 10.75 in.
Weight - 2.3 lbs
Flow Rate - 0.4…55 gpm
Extended Low Flow Rate - 0.25 gpm
Pressure Loss - 1.8 psi at 25 gpm

Agency Approvals

AWWA – Designed to meet and exceed applicable portions of ANSI/AWWA standard C700. NOTE: No current AWWA standard specifically addresses ultrasonic meters for residential applications.
NSF – Complies with the lead-free provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, certified to NSF/ANSI Standards 61 and 372 and the NSF-61 mark on the housing.

High Resolution Output Protocol - Available for all Engineered Polymer Meters


Providing more than just a reading, the high resolution protocol provides visibility to status indicators including: meter functioning correctly, meter alarm (includes empty pipe, low temperature, other meter or sensor issues), reverse flow, suspected leak, 30-day no usage, and battery end-of-life. The HR E-Series provides connectivity to Badger Meter ORION® Cellular, Fixed Network (SE), Migratable (ME), and Classic (CE) endpoints as well as Itron 100W Erts using the industry standard ASCII protocol. Approved endpoints, including ORION Cellular, ORION Fixed Network (SE) and ORION Migratable (ME), transmit the status indicators to the BEACON AMA software.


Endpoint Reading Resolutions


The E-Series Ultrasonic meter high resolution output is nine digits. Reading resolutions sent to the reading software rely on the encoder/endpoint connection. Readings reported from the endpoints are the left-most significant digits of the encoder reading. In addition to reading resolution, the status indicator reporting capabilities of the encoder are dependent on both the endpoint technology and the version of reading management software.


Customer Education


Direct and Distributor sales may share hardware/software requirements with existing ORION, GALAXY® and ITRON customers when discussing the new high resolution output, and most importantly, at time of first order.


Prior to placing a first-time order of high resolution E-Series Ultrasonic meters, consult Pivotal customer equipment records to make sure that existing ORION, GALAXY or ITRON customers have the required versions of hardware/software.


Lead Time


Standard E-Series Ultrasonic meter lead times apply and will be based on demand.


Pricing


The Utility Products Price list has been updated to include pricing for the new 1” engineered polymer ultrasonic meter. The E-Series Ultrasonic engineered polymer meter has been priced to provide utilities with a cost effective metering option for utilities looking to deploy electronic meters.


Warranty


Identical to the Badger Meter stainless steel ultrasonic meters, engineered polymer meters have a twenty (20) years and six (6) months materials and workmanship warranty. The electronics, battery, transducer, and register are warranted for twenty (20) years and six (6) months; prorated after shipment from Badger Meter.
