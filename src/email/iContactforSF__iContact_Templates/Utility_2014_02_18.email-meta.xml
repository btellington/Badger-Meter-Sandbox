Update: More Choices for ORION Cellular Starter Kit


The ORION Cellular Starter Kit has been updated to offer utilities a choice between ORION Cellular endpoints or ORION Cellular endpoints with HR-E LCD encoders. Both options are priced the same in order to help promote and encourage the deployment of the LCD encoder. Utilities may mix and match configurations to customize the Starter Kit to fit their specific deployment needs. As a reminder, ORION Cellular Starter Kits are available to end utility customers only and ORION Cellular endpoints must drop-ship directly to the end utility customer. Updated customer-facing and pricing documents can be found on the Badger Meter extranet.
