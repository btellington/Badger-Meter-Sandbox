BEACON AMA Starter Kit Training Process


With the purchase of a BEACON AMA starter kit, customers receive four hours of WebEx training.


Below is an outline of the BEACON AMA starter kit training process. These steps will help customers better understand what they will need to do in order to take full advantage of their starter kit:

Upon receipt of the order, Kelley Johnson, support service specialist, contacts the customer to give them an overview of the training process.
The customer receives their 10 cellular endpoints, after which, Kelley and the customer set training dates –
two, two-hour WebEx sessions, approximately two weeks apart.
In the initial two-hour WebEx training, the customer receives access to the BEACON AMA software suite and is trained on endpoint installation and provisioning, creating users and given an overview of BEACON AMA.
The customer installs and provisions the endpoints.
The endpoints collect a week or two of data.
In the second WebEx training, the customer is trained on obtaining reads and gets a detailed look at software with data, a review of the dashboard and other features.

Please contact Kristie Anderson if you have any questions.



Now Available in the App Store: BEACON AMA Installation App-BEACONTool


With the convenience and ease of a mobile app, BEACONTool facilitates the installation of ORION® Cellular endpoints.


Installers use BEACONTool to:

See and locate their assigned endpoint installation jobs.
Use smart phone mapping along with walking and driving directions to locate the meter.
Use GPS tools to establish the location of the meter if current records are not available or need to be updated.
Take pictures of meter installations for historical purposes.
Once installed, activate the ORION Cellular endpoint.

Use of the app will require that login credentials and jobs be established by an admin user of a utility that has deployed a BEACON AMA managed solution. The app can be found by searching for BEACONTool or Badger Meter in the iTunes

App Store.

BEACON AMA Q&amp;A


Question: How does the conversion of existing billing data work?


Answer: The one-time conversion of existing billing data allows BEACON AMA to be configured to accept up to three years of historical readings from the utility’s billing software. This data helps support some of the historical and tracking features of BEACON AMA for both the utility and end water customer to use once the system is deployed.


Question: Does BEACON AMA require the customer to use Google Maps for the presentation layer?


Answer: Today, BEACON AMA is designed to use Google Maps as its mapping layer. ESRI integration may be considered for future development.


Question: How customizable is the Key Account Overview widget?


Answer: The target account widget is fully customizable and populated by each user by selecting the star in the upper left-hand corner of the desired account card.


Please contact Kristie Anderson if you have any questions.



Trimble Ranger 3 ORION Classic (CE) Handhelds


Badger Meter has elected to proactively replace the ORION Classic (CE) receiver circuit board in all Trimble Ranger 3 handhelds, at no charge to the end utility customer. This will ensure our customers receive the maximum reading performance from their handheld reading devices. End utility customers will be contacted by the Badger Meter Technical Support team in order of original handheld shipment date to see if they wish to receive a no charge radio receiver replacement and handheld software update. Customers electing to return their handheld for the retrofit will receive a six-month extension added to their current service agreement term.


As a reminder, customer contacts will be made in order of original date of shipment. This process may not be bypassed because it may lead to unnecessary processing delays. Sales may contact Technical Support to obtain an account manager/distributor-specific customer listing for review.


Please contact Sheila Nally if you have any questions.
