BEACON AMA Starter Kits - May Update


As of this week, Badger Meter sales representatives have sold a combined total of 45 BEACON AMA Starter Kits! This is amazing progress just three months after the BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics product launch. Be sure to continue promoting these Starter Kits as a quick, easy and inexpensive way for a competitive account to try
out a state-of-the-art Badger Meter solution. More
information about BEACON AMA Starter Kits can be found on the BEACON AMA Starter Kit web page or the BEACON AMA Starter Kit Marketing Program.


Great job by National Meter &amp; Automation for selling three already this month. Scott Jones, Atlas Utility Supply Company and Waller’s Meter each sold one as well. Keep up the great work, everyone!

ORION® Fixed Network (SE) and Migratable (ME) Endpoint Housing Change


Badger Meter has standardized the material used for all ORION Cellular, Fixed Network and Migratable endpoint housings. While still medium gray, when compared side-by-side with previously shipped endpoints, you will notice a slight coloration difference and a matte finish. Please note, these changes are cosmetic only. There are no functional or performance differences between this new housing material and the material
previously used.


To differentiate the endpoint types, all ORION endpoints are engraved and provided with a harness label. As an example, ORION Cellular endpoints will be engraved &quot;ORION Cellular CDMA&quot; and ORION Fixed Network endpoints for encoders will be marked &quot;ORION SE ENC&quot;.


Please contact Sheila Nally if you have any questions.
