ACE14: Trade Show Recap


Badger Meter attended AWWA&apos;s Annual

Conference and Exposition in Boston, MA last week (June 8th - June 11th). With a new booth, ACE14 was our first opportunity since the DistribuTECH product launch to showcase BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) to utility trade show attendees.


Booth attendance was high, with consistent traffic throughout the entire show. We were particularly excited about the strong turnout for BEACON AMA product demonstrations, with a number of customers visiting solely for that reason.


Other highlights included:

ACE14 Technical Session, &quot;How Is Technology Changing the Water Utility Industry?&quot;, hosted by Badger Meter.
Water Online radio interview with John Fillinger.
Video interview with Kristie Anderson and AWWA (link to video coming soon).
CEO Reception at the Boston Tea Party Museum, hosted by Rich Meeusen.
New England Microbrews and Martinis at the Badger Meter booth (featuring the &quot;Flowing B Stinger&quot;)!

BEACON AMA Starter Kits - June Update

June has already been a busy month for BEACON AMA Starter Kit sales! Great job to everyone who tallied a sale over the past two weeks. Attendance for BEACON AMA demonstrations at ACE14 was high, so be sure to capitalize on this momentum with existing or competitive accounts!


A special congratulations to Angie Phillips, who was able to sell a BEACON AMA Starter Kit with an expanded number of ORION Cellular endpoints!


Remember, if your customer is interested in additional ORION endpoints with their BEACON AMA Starter Kit, we can work with them on a case-by-case basis to better prepare for a full BEACON AMA deployment.
