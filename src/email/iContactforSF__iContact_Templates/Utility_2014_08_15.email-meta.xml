Amazon Security and Privacy Whitepaper for BEACON AMA Now Available on the Badger Meter Extranet

A detailed report from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the provider of cloud services for Badger Meter Beacon Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA), is now available on the Badger Meter extranet. It is a detailed report from AWS that addresses many topics regarding physical security, data security and access, that is an important piece to the foundation of our overall BEACON AMA security strategy. An additional whitepaper will be released by Badger Meter that addresses information regarding our own privacy and security policies beyond that of AWS. While the AWS whitepaper is available to the general public on their website, we are posting it on the Badger Meter extranet so you can more properly present it to interested customers.

Download the AWS Security and Privacy Whitepaper on the Badger Meter extranet.

Please contact Dan Merritt if you have any questions.



Local Register and RTR Design Modification


Badger Meter is incorporating a modification to the sweep hand for all local registers and Recordall速 Transmitter Registers (RTR). When compared side-by-side with current production, there is now a slightly thicker sweep hand in the new design.

This design change will go into effect mid-September and encoders built with the new sweep hand will start with a date code of 0415. Orders in the system will be built with one style sweep hand. There will not be mixed orders.





Please contact Jan Boyer if you have any questions.



ModMAG On-Hand Inventory Report


Note: The ModMAG On-Hand Inventory Report has been updated and is available for download on the Badger Meter extranet. This report is meant to notify sales of the slow moving or special built mag meters that are currently in stock that would qualify for a faster delivery lead time. The report will be updated every two weeks and is subject to change.
