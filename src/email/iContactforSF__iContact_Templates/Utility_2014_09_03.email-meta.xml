BEACON AMA Q&amp;A

Question: What is the BEACON Engagement Fee?

Answer: The BEACON Engagement Fee accounts for the set up and initialization of the BEACON AMA software suite. It is required for all BEACON AMA deployments once a customer proceeds with interfacing BEACON AMA to their utility billing software. Generally speaking, the fee is not required for BEACON AMA Starter Kits, since the interface is not completed until later in the sales cycle. If a starter kit is deployed with an interface to billing, the BEACON Engagement Fee applies.

Please contact Kristie Anderson if you have any questions.


Itron 60W Transition


In an effort to transition existing Itron 60W customers to the 100W+ ERT, Badger Meter will no longer stock 60W ERT product. We will continue to fulfill customer requests for 60W ERTs, but lead times will be dictated by how long it takes for 60W product to be shipped to Badger Meter after we submit a purchase order to Itron. To prepare for this transition, customers should be advised that lead times for 60W ERTs will  likely extend to a minimum of eight weeks for all orders.  Appropriate actions should be taken by the customer to account for the additional lead time. In addition, customers will not be able to cancel orders for 60W ERTs once an order has been entered in our system.

As the leading reseller of water ERTs, Badger Meter will continue to stock the 100W+ ERT, which offers the same mobile reading capabilities as the 60W ERT, plus additional features. Please work with the small remaining number of Itron customers to get them transitioned from the 60W to the 100W+ ERT as soon as possible.


Please contact Sheila Nally if you have any questions.

BEACON AMA Featured on Dallas CBS TV Station


After Jarrod Greenwood, Public Works Director for Westlake, TX, tweeted about the new water metering system the city was testing, the Dallas CBS station took notice and featured BEACON AMA in a news segment. While the segment doesn’t mention BEACON AMA or Badger Meter by name, the BEACON AMA website is shown and compares the ability of BEACON AMA to other modern systems which notify customers when certain conditions exist.
