2014 Year of Manufacturing Serial Numbers


As of last week, we have run out of 2014 Year of Manufacturing serial numbers. This is due to the increased volume of orders this year and the increase in requests for year of manufacturing serial number (14XXXXXX). Meters and encoders for orders entered as of last week (week of 9/15/14) that have been configured with year of manufacturing serial numbers have transitioned to the year of manufacture 2015 and will begin with 15 instead of 14.


Please note, we are currently reviewing options and a possible move towards an alpha-numeric year of manufacture serial number.
