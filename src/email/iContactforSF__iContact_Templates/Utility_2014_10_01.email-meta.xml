A new video, Solutions Proposal for Wisconsin Utilities, is now available on the Badger Meter extranet. Presented by Morrice Blackwell, new product sales and market development manager at Badger Meter, the video covers a short background on who Badger Meter is, the possible goals of water utilities and how BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics can help a water utility meet its objectives.

Build-to-Order: Special Capabilities Extending Beyond Stocked Meter Offering


Our new stocked meter plan offers shorter lead times for a wide breadth of ModMAG® M-Series® meters, which meet the requirements of many common applications. However, in some unique or especially challenging applications, there may be a need for a meter to be engineered outside the realm of our stocked meter offering. This includes larger meter sizes, extended lay lengths, special liner material, and any other option not included in the scope of our stocked meter specifications.

New ModMAG Custom Solutions Flyer
The new flyer shows examples of custom solution capabilities within our ModMAG product line, including extended lay lengths and extra-large pipe sizes – when lead times are not critical.

Download the flyer on the Badger Meter extranet.

Custom Meters Currently in Stock - Available with
Shorter Lead Times
We currently have several meters in inventory that aren&apos;t typically kept on-hand. The following list is a snapshot of the &quot;special&quot; meters in stock. These meters, although outside of the normal specification of our stocked meter offering, are able to ship under shorter lead times while supplies last.






Please contact your account manager or customer service representative for more information.




High Resolution Encoders (HR-E)

Reminder: Please work with your customers to transition them from the ADE® to one of our two high resolution encoder offerings – the High Resolution Encoder (HR-E) or the High Resolution LCD encoder (HR-E LCD).

As the transition phase begins, Badger Meter will need to balance current inventory with product availability from our suppliers. Therefore, all quote proposals that include an ADE encoder will have an expiration date no later than March 31, 2015 and must include the right to substitute clause.

Important action items include:

Obtain product approvals as required.
Get customer bid specs changed. Note: Upcoming bid extensions are an opportune time to make the transition.
Do not wait for bids to expire to begin transition process.
Adjust your forecasts from ADE to the HR-E or
HR-E LCD.
For ORION® solutions, please remember to work with your customers to apply the appropriate test circle code or multipliers.
Transition customers from 60W to the Badger Meter ORION solution or Itron 100W+.
Provide reference account information to Jan Boyer.

Please contact Jan Boyer if you have any questions.



Portable Large Meter Testing (PLMT) Update


Based on feedback from our customers and as part of continuous improvement to our products, we have transitioned to a butterfly valve on our PLMT.   Beginning in October, you will begin to see the new valve incorporated into the PLMT. Literature is in process of being updated and will include a selling brief that will help you with any customer questions.  Over the course of the next few months, we will continue to make improvements to the overall design of the PLMT and will provide updates as the product design is finalized.


Please contact Jan Boyer if you have any questions.
