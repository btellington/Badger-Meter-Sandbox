BEACON AMA Starter Kits: Mid-October 2014 Update

Continued great work by the sales team and channel partners for the last couple of weeks! Since our last update, 8 starter kits have been sold, bringing the total to 161 BEACON AMA starter kits deployed in the United States!


As a reminder, customers who are interested in deploying a BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) starter kit with more than the standard amount of ORION® Cellular endpoints may work with their sales representative to discuss pricing for an expanded starter kit.

HR-E® Approved Connectivity with Itron 100W+ ERT

Badger Meter is pleased to announce the HR-E 8-dial encoder has formal connectivity approval with Itron 100W+ ERTS. The option for the HR-E with or for Itron 100W+ ERTS will be available in the configurator next week. Please anticipate a six-week lead time at initial release.

Pricing pages for the encoder and the 100W+ ERT assembly have been updated to include reference to the HR-E.

As a reminder, Itron has chosen not to support the 60W for high resolution output. 60W customers should be transitioned to a BEACON AMA solution or to the 100W+ ERT.

Please contact Jan Boyer if you have any questions.


ModMAG® M-Series® Stocked Item Enhancement


M2000 and M4000 DC power options have been added to the mag meter stock item list. The additional stocked meters will enhance our stocked offering to include the most commonly purchased models at pre-determined, shorter lead times.


The revised document can be found on the Badger Meter extranet. Stay tuned for updates on the ModMAG stocked meter offering in future eNews messages.


Please contact Brooke Lange if you have any questions.
