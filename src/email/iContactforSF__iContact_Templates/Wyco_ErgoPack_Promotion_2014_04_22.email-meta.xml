    <textOnly>Wyco ErgoPack Scoring Update


Scott Dennis of Lew Hudson remains in first place after two big three-pointers last week, but Tim Elenbass of Ebbert Co. cut the lead in half with a three-point score of his own. David Peve from MJ Miller remains in second place, with the others close behind.


After two short weeks of the ErgoPack Spring Stocking promotion, each representative remains within striking distance - just one or two sales - of the top spot.






FAQ: Cleaning Your Wyco ErgoPack


Question: How do I clean the Wyco ErgoPack?


Answer: Remove the backpack material from the frame and place in a tub or shower filled with water and scrub with pH-neutral soap. Salt stains are easily removed by washing with soap and plenty of water, while dirt and other stains can be cleaned with a soft brush.



Question: Can I use a washing machine to clean the backpack?


Answer: No, do not wash the backpack in a washing machine. Abrasion from the machine will wear out the material and reduce the life of your ErgoPack.



Question: What happens if the ErgoPack backpack isn&apos;t properly or fully rinsed after washing?


Answer: Residue that hasn&apos;t been properly rinsed from the ErgoPack can lead to skin irritation during regular use. In addition, a chemical reaction from soap or detergent with sweat and UV rays can further damage the backpack material. Please be sure to rinse thoroughly after each wash.
