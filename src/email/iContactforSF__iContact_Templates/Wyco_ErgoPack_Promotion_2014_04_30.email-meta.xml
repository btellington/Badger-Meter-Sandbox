    <textOnly>Wyco ErgoPack Scoring Update


The Wyco Spring Stocking Promotion is now in full swing! Tim Elenbaas of Ebbert Co. took a commanding lead, scoring twelve points since just last week. Scott Dennis tallied another three-pointer of his own, and remains right on the heels of first place.


Ron Hoffman of Cardinal Sales, Neal Noga of MJ Miller, and Bill McAnany of CSI Marketing all got onto the scoreboard this week and are now right in the thick of it. To all of our representatives: keep up the good work! This is still anybody&apos;s game.






Upcoming Wyco Materials


The product promotion banner is a 2’ x 3’ vinyl banner with full-color images of the Sure Speed, 994 and ErgoPack units and the Wyco patented Square Head. This banner will surely be a great addition to your product show room, front counter or any high traffic area letting customers know you sell advanced Square Head vibrators from Wyco.




The banners are part of the Distributor Stocking Program running through June 16, 2014. All qualifying orders will receive a Wyco banner. Banner supplies are limited, one per location on a first come first served basis, so place your Spring stocking order now. Available in the US and Canada only.
