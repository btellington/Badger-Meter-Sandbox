    <textOnly>Wyco ErgoPack Scoring Update


Lots of action this past week in the ErgoPack Spring Stocking Promotion. As a group, representives went from 48 total points up to 55! Great momentum as we enter the final month of the competition.


A reminder of the Promotion rules can be found here.


Tim Elenbaas remains the &quot;top dog&quot; after another week, but it is too close for comfort, with a number of challengers threatening. Scott Dennis of Lew Hudson tallied another point, putting him at double-digits with 10 points overall. Neal Noga of MJ Miller now has sole ownership of third place, with a big three-pointer this week. Greg Klein of Larrabee more than doubled his previous score, now at 5 points total.
