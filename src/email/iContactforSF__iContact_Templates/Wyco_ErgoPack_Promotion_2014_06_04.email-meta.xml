    <textOnly>Wyco ErgoPack Scoring Update


After a busy couple of weeks, 74 points have been scored overall in the Spring Stocking Promotion! MJ Miller currently leads all rep groups, with 21 points scored by their sales representatives.


Mike Nowak of CSI Marketing jumped into third place after a three-pointer, and needs just two more to catch Tim Elenbaas, who remained in the top spot. Randy LaPerle of Kennett &amp; Associates surged onto the leaderboard with six points scored since the last update. Ron Fleener of Larrabee also joined the party, scoring one point and looking for a late comeback.


We are now officially in the home stretch, with just two weeks of competition left. It&apos;s still anyone&apos;s game - who will take home the grand prize?






Reminder: Wyco Promotional Materials


The product promotion banner is a 2’ x 3’ vinyl banner with full-color images of the Sure Speed, 994 and ErgoPack units and the Wyco patented Square Head. This banner will surely be a great addition to your product show room, front counter or any high traffic area letting customers know you sell advanced Square Head vibrators from Wyco.
