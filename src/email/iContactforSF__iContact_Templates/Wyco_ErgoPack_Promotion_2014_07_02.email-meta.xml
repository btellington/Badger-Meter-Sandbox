    <textOnly>Wyco ErgoPack Scoring Update


Since our last Wyco ErgoPack scoring update, the total score in the sales contest reached 134 points overall. Over forty points were scored during the past two weeks, as reflected in the newest leaderboard update. With just under one month remaining, there are more reps within striking distance of a prize than ever. Keep up the great work!


After a very busy month of June, Tim Elenbaas of Ebbert Co. widened his leading score to 27 points overall. Mike Nowak of CSI Marketing continued his push toward the top spot, netting 15 points total. The trio of Greg Klein, Neal Noga and Scott Dennis are right in the thick of it, all tied with 10 points for third place.


Chuck Arnone of Lew Hudson, and Brian Robinson of Ebbert Co., both emerged with big scores, totaling six and four points, respectively. Dan Bowell, Todd Nielson and Troy Ebbert each netted their first three-pointer as well.


REMEMBER: Participants may continue tallying points for the sales contest through July 31st.
