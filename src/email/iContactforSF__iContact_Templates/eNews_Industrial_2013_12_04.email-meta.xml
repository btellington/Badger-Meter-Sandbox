Industrial Edition | December 4, 2013

Confidential &amp; Proprietary


Improved Conval Output from ISA Specification Form for Research Control® Valves
As part of our efforts to grow Research Control Valves, we have reformatted and updated our Conval calculation output, which is a product of the ISA Valve Specification Form on our website. The new output now provides a simple, easy-to-read input and calculated data. It also will include a characteristic which identifies the Max, Min and Norm set-points. These set-points are represented on a graph for ease of use and will be the standard output for everything sized at the factory.
Future Improvements:

Streamlining our output to include calculation tools, drawings, actuator forces, an ISA data sheet, tech briefs, user manuals and guiding options.
Provide a more robust sizing calculator for our partners in the field.

​Please provide feedback on our valve specification tools by contacting Brian Kettner, marketing manager.

Research Control® SCV95 3 Inch Size Discontinued


Effective immediately, the SCV95 sanitary control valve three inch model is discontinued. We will continue to offer and support the SCV95 two inch model. There are no other changes to our sanitary valve offering.
Badger Meter is committed to delivering rugged and versatile pneumatic, electronic and digital process control solutions. The new Product Data Sheets, which outline the new SCV95 offering, are available on our website.
Please contact Brian Kettner, marketing manager, with any questions.
